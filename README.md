# Forest
Forest - Create your own forest soundscape

## About the project
In a complicated and stressed world you need time to relax and get back to your full strength.
*Forest* is a web application that lets you create your own forest soundscape.
The main aim is to give you a simple tool to relax and imagine yourself in a forest of your choice. You can choose the soundscape and regulate intensities of elements as you wish. You like more birds? Or a waterfall? Or a walk in a rainy forest? No problem. Your changes will act immediately. You can build your own forest or take a sound dive in a random forest. Sit back and enjoy!

## Live-Demo
You can check out the latest version:
* [Forest](https://moritzott.github.io/forest/)

## Enhancement
Currently *Forest* is a pure web application based on HTML, CSS and Javascript. That's why you need an internet connection to run it in your browser. I'm working on an offline version, so that you can enjoy *Forest* wherever you are (independent from your interent connection). Probably I will develop a so called Progressive Web App (PWA), since it seems the easiest way, given the current state of the application. A mobile app version could also be realized with frameworks like Apache Cordova or the Ionic Framework. I'll let you know when it's ready.

## Bugs, Errors and new Features

## Latest Version
Current version is **Version 0.1**.
